     * A pirate is standing a the top of a 𝑁×𝑀 table where each element in the table represents the number of golden

     * either straight, or to the left or to the right (if possible). His goal is to collect as many golden coins as possible. 
     * Find a way to help the pirate to do that using dynamic programming
